               <h1 class="heading">WHAT IS MOUNTAINEERING</h1>
               <p class="para p-2">  Mountaineering, also called mountain climbing, the sport of attaining, or attempting to attain, high points in mountainous regions, mainly for the pleasure of the climb.Mountaineering differs from other outdoor sports in that nature alone provides the field of action—and just about all of the challenges—for the participant. For most climbers, the pleasures of mountaineering lie not only in the “conquest” of a peak but also in the physical and spiritual satisfactions brought about through intense personal effort, ever-increasing proficiency, and contact with natural grandeur.Although the term is often loosely applied to walking up low mountains that offer only moderate difficulties, it is more properly restricted to climbing in localities where the terrain and weather conditions present such hazards that, for safety, a certain amount of previous experience will be found necessary. For the untrained, mountaineering is a dangerous pastime. </p>

               <h1 class="heading">HISTORY OF MOUNTAINEERING</h1>
               <p class="para p-2">  Early attempts to ascend mountain peaks were inspired by other than sporting motives: to build altars or to see if spirits actually haunted once-forbidden heights, to get an overview of one’s own or a neighbouring countryside, or to make meteorological or geological observations.Mountaineering in a contemporary sporting sense was born when a young Genevese scientist, Horace-Bénédict de Saussure, on a first visit to Chamonix in 1760, viewed Mont Blanc (at 15,771 feet [4,807 metres] the tallest peak in Europe) and determined that he would climb to the top of it or be responsible for its being climbed.  The British expedition that in May 1955 climbed Kanchenjunga, often considered one of the world’s most-difficult mountaineering challenges, was led by Charles Evans, who had been deputy leader of the first successful climb of Everest.In the 1950s came a series of successful ascents of mountains in the Himalayas: a first climb by the French of Annapurna I (26,545 feet [8,091 metres]) in June 1950, Nanga Parbat (26,660 feet [8,126 metres]) by the Germans and Austrians in 1953, Kanchenjunga (28,169 feet [8,586 metres]) by the British in May 1955, and Lhotse I (27,940 feet [8,516 metres]) by the Swiss in 1956.  </p>

      <h1 class="heading"> HAZARDS </h1>
      <p class="para p-2"> There are many hazards to mountain climbing that can ruin a summit or even cost a climber his life.
        Some of the hazards are: falling rocks and ice, avalanches, ice and snow slopes, crevasses, weather, climber falls, and altitude.
        Perhaps the most expected or common hazards are natural disasters, such as falling debris or weather storms. Many people do not expect physical ailments to result in so many deaths. Altitude and cardiac attacks can claim many lives, especially on the taller mountains, where there is less oxygen available.
        Climbing ascents up mountains, such as Mt. Everest, taken three to four months because of the time needed to acclimatize to the lack of oxygen. Once climbers reach a certain elevation, there are strategic base camps set up where climbers will spend days, weeks, or even months getting used to (acclimatizing) to the lack of oxygen.

<!-- Other notable developments included an increase in the “Alpine” style of climbing the highest peaks, where mountaineers carried a minimal amount of equipment and supplies and did not rely on porters and other outside support, and a rise in the number of people climbing at high elevations without the use of supplemental oxygen. -->
